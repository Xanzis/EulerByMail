# EulerByMail
Solving project Euler problems, one line at a time!


The rules:
- Switch off writing lines
- No particular timeline, as long a rule 1 is observed
- To be complete, the program must print a number which is the correct answer to the given project euler problem
- No comments! Variables may be named informatively, but only within reason.

Bookkeeping:
- We should make programs one at a time
- Depending on their status, programs will have names like "E002_current.sage" or "E037_done.sage"
- I don't think we have to go through project euler sequentially - let's just pick out ones (starting easy) that will be fun to do.
